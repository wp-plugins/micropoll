Easily integrate web-based polls from MicroPoll into WordPress

== Description ==

<a href="http://www.micropoll.com" title="MicroPoll">MicroPoll</a> is a service that allows you to gather customer responses to polls on your website.

Normally, JavaScript code has to be inserted on each page where you want micropoll to be used. That approach requires editing of templates and including conditionals based on post ID.

This plugin makes it easy to incorporate the MicroPoll service in your WordPress blog without editing templates by providing a MicroPoll widget that can be used in any widget-ready theme.

Once you have installed MicroPoll, navigate to the configuration page and paste in your poll embed code from the <a href="http://www.micropoll.com/" title="plugin_name">MicroPoll web site</a>.
